## Brief

In HandsUp, you can sign up your account and post what you want others to help. Every one can use comments to talk to each other. If someone solve your problem, you can easily turn the status of your post from "Seek help" to "Done", in this case, the comments function will also closed.

You can also use google map to see the location of the task to help you make decisions. In addition, using search and filter function can help you find the tasks easily
